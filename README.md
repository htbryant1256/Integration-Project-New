# Meal Planning Integration Project
  This project is a meal planning application that goes off of a users BMI and daily calories. I made this project by my self. I made this project about 3 months into c++. I made this project because at the time I was interested in working out and meal planning, so I made a meal planning application. I made this project during COP3003 at FGCU.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
LO4. Include a comment in which you compare and contrast the procedural/functional approach and the object-oriented approach
Compare Contrast Prodecural Programing:
    Procedural programing is good for small quick solutions, that opperate
    squentially. While as functional programing should be used for
    larger scale projects. This is because many of the functions and classes
    written can be reused again for other purposes.

LO3. Correctly reason about control flow in a program using dynamic dispatch.
Control Flow and Dynamic Dispatch:
    Dynamic dispatch is when a method is decided at runtime depending on what object
    the code is pointing to. This allows for the more fluidity in the code and overall reuseablity. 
    By using dynamic dispatch to change the control flow of a program can overall be more efficient than
    calling individual methods from objects.
LO5. Explain the relationship between object-oriented inheritance (code-sharing and overriding) and subtyping (the idea of a subtype being usable in a context that expects the supertype).
Relationship Between OOI and Subtyping:
    OOI is when a derived class inherits the public methods of the parent class.
    This aids in resuing code and the overall orginization of the code. By using virtual
    functions and overriding methods, the derived class can have a different result from a 
    method with the same name in the parent class.
