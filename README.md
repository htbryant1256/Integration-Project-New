# Meal Planning Integration Project
  This project is a meal planning application that goes off of a users BMI and daily calories. I made this project by my self. I made this project about 3 months into c++. I made this project because at the time I was interested in working out and meal planning, so I made a meal planning application. I made this project during COP3003 at FGCU.
